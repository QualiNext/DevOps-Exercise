# Welcome to your DevOps Community exercise!
In this exercise, you will be containerizing a simple application written in NodeJS and Mongo using GitHub Actions.

### Github Actions
GitHub actions will be used as an open-source ci/cd tool. It's already configured for the repository and being triggered for every push event in the repo. When a change is introduced to the repository, the GitHub Action workflow is triggered using NodeJS best-practices CI to download all the project dependencies, compile the project, and run some tests.

> Kick-off workflows with GitHub events like push, issue creation, or a new release. Combine and configure actions for the services you use, built, and maintained by the community.
> Whether you want to build a container, deploy a web service, or automate welcoming new users to your open source projectsâ€”there's an action for that. Pair GitHub Packages with Actions to simplify package management, including version updates, fast distribution with our global CDN, and dependency resolution, using your existing GITHUB_TOKEN.

### About our buggy app
Our app is just a Simple Todo App with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js. It's not very stable and has many bugs all over. 
It's main features are:
- Register new users
- Add & Delete tasks
- Logout

### Running the application locally is easy!
* Note: you need MongoDB installed on the machine to run the application.
1) clone the project
2) cd into the project folder
3) run `npm install`
4) run `npm start`
